# Advanced Calculator with GUI

## Overview
This project is an advanced calculator built with Python, featuring both basic and scientific operations. The calculator now includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library, allowing users to interact seamlessly without the need for console inputs.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Scientific Functions:** 
    - Square and square root.
    - Cube and cube root.
    - Logarithmic (base 10).
    - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) and their inverses (asin, acos, atan).
    - Power function.
3. **Error Handling:** Prevents invalid operations, such as division by zero or logarithm of non-positive numbers.
4. **GUI Integration:**
    - Buttons for each operation.
    - Entry fields for user inputs.
    - Display area for results.
5. **Real-Time Interaction:** Updates results dynamically based on user inputs and selections.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later.
- Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python).

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python calculator_gui.py
   ```

4. The calculator GUI will launch, and you can start performing calculations.

## Project Structure

- `calculator_gui.py`: The main script containing the logic and GUI components.

## Usage Instructions

1. Enter the required numbers in the input fields.
2. Select an operation by clicking the corresponding button.
3. View the result displayed on the GUI.
4. For advanced operations (like power or logarithm), follow on-screen prompts.
